# arvigoswordmod
A practice mod for Minecraft 1.16.5

Run on the Forge 1.16.5-36.1.0 MDK.
I'm not sure of compatability with non-Windows OS, or other versions of Forge/Minecraft

Adds the block "Henrium Ore" (Building Blocks Tab), the item "Henrium" (Miscellaneous Tab), and the "Henrium Sword" (Combat Tab). 


All of these items can be found in their respctive tabs on creative. A Henrium Sword can be crafted by the normal sword recipe, substituting Henrium instead of an ore.
Currently Henrium does not spawn naturally, and needs to be placed in creative or by the command "give @[player name] arvigoswordmod:[Item] [quantity]

To install and play this mod:
  1) Download the recommended version of Forge for 1.16.5 https://files.minecraftforge.net/maven/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.16.5.html
  2) Install on the default settings, go to the Minecaft Launcher, and under versions you should see the Forge version, run it once and exit the game.
  3) Press Windows Key+R and type in "%appdata%
  4) Go to Roaming > .minecraft where there should be a "mods" folder
  5) Drag in the "arvigoswordmod.jar" file, which can be found in the releases tab of this github page (usually on the sidebar)
  6) Reload Minecraft on the Forge version, under the Mods menu in the Minecraft welcome screen you should see Arvigo Sword Mod
  7) Start a new world, you'll have to give yourself the items with commands or in the creative tabs
